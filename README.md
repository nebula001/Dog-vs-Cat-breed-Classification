# Dog-vs-Cat-breed-Classification
This is a Deep Learning model which uses CNN to classify 12 cat breeds and 25 dog breeds.
We are going to use the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) by [O. M. Parkhi et al., 2012](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2012/parkhi12a/parkhi12a.pdf) which features 12 cat breeds and 25 dogs breeds. This model will need to learn to differentiate between these 37 distinct categories.

According to their paper, the best accuracy they could get in 2012 was 59.21%, using a complex model that was specific to pet detection, with separate "Image", "Head", and "Body" models for the pet photos. 
But using resnet 34 architecture we achieved the accuracy of 92.42% and using resnet 50 architecture we achieved the accuracy of 95.33% which are pretty good!

All the steps and process have been described and explained in the Notebook itself.
